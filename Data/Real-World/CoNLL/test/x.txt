JAPAN
GET
LUCKY
WIN
,
CHINA
IN
SURPRISE
DEFEAT
.

1996-12-06

Japan
began
the
defence
of
their
Asian
Cup
title
with
a
lucky
2-1
win
against
Syria
in
a
Group
C
championship
match
on
Friday
.

But
China
saw
their
luck
desert
them
in
the
second
match
of
the
group
,
crashing
to
a
surprise
2-0
defeat
to
newcomers
Uzbekistan
.

China
controlled
most
of
the
match
and
saw
several
chances
missed
until
the
78th
minute
when
Uzbek
striker
Igor
Shkvyrin
took
advantage
of
a
misdirected
defensive
header
to
lob
the
ball
over
the
advancing
Chinese
keeper
and
into
an
empty
net
.

Oleg
Shatskiku
made
sure
of
the
win
in
injury
time
,
hitting
an
unstoppable
left
foot
shot
from
just
outside
the
area
.

The
former
Soviet
republic
was
playing
in
an
Asian
Cup
finals
tie
for
the
first
time
.

Despite
winning
the
Asian
Games
title
two
years
ago
,
Uzbekistan
are
in
the
finals
as
outsiders
.

Two
goals
from
defensive
errors
in
the
last
six
minutes
allowed
Japan
to
come
from
behind
and
collect
all
three
points
from
their
opening
meeting
against
Syria
.

Takuya
Takagi
scored
the
winner
in
the
88th
minute
,
rising
to
head
a
Hiroshige
Yanagimoto
cross
towards
the
Syrian
goal
which
goalkeeper
Salem
Bitar
appeared
to
have
covered
but
then
allowed
to
slip
into
the
net
.

It
was
the
second
costly
blunder
by
Syria
in
four
minutes
.

Defender
Hassan
Abbas
rose
to
intercept
a
long
ball
into
the
area
in
the
84th
minute
but
only
managed
to
divert
it
into
the
top
corner
of
Bitar
's
goal
.

Nader
Jokhadar
had
given
Syria
the
lead
with
a
well-struck
header
in
the
seventh
minute
.

Japan
then
laid
siege
to
the
Syrian
penalty
area
for
most
of
the
game
but
rarely
breached
the
Syrian
defence
.

Bitar
pulled
off
fine
saves
whenever
they
did
.

Japan
coach
Shu
Kamo
said
:
'
'
The
Syrian
own
goal
proved
lucky
for
us
.

The
Syrians
scored
early
and
then
played
defensively
and
adopted
long
balls
which
made
it
hard
for
us
.
'

'

Japan
,
co-hosts
of
the
World
Cup
in
2002
and
ranked
20th
in
the
world
by
FIFA
,
are
favourites
to
regain
their
title
here
.

CUTTITTA
BACK
FOR
ITALY
AFTER
A
YEAR
.

ROME
1996-12-06

Italy
recalled
Marcello
Cuttitta

on
Friday
for
their
friendly
against
Scotland
at
Murrayfield
more
than
a
year
after
the
30-year-old
wing
announced
he
was
retiring
following
differences
over
selection
.

Cuttitta
,
who
trainer
George
Coste
said
was
certain
to
play
on
Saturday
week
,
was
named
in
a
21-man
squad
lacking
only
two
of
the
team
beaten
54-21
by
England
at
Twickenham
last
month
.

Stefano
Bordon
is
out
through
illness
and
Coste
said
he
had
dropped
back
row
Corrado
Covi
,
who
had
been
recalled
for
the
England
game
after
five
years
out
of
the
national
team
.

Cuttitta
announced
his
retirement
after
the
1995
World
Cup
,
where
he
took
issue
with
being
dropped
from
the
Italy
side
that
faced
England
in
the
pool
stages
.

Coste
said
he
had
approached
the
player
two
months
ago
about
a
comeback
.

"
He
ended
the
World
Cup
on
the
wrong
note
,
"
Coste
said
.

"
I
thought
it
would
be
useful
to
have
him
back
and
he
said
he
would
be
available
.

I
think
now
is
the
right
time
for
him
to
return
.

LATE
GOALS
GIVE
JAPAN
WIN
OVER
SYRIA
.

AL-AIN
,
United
Arab
Emirates
1996-12-06

Two
goals
in
the
last
six
minutes
gave
holders
Japan
an
uninspiring
2-1
Asian
Cup
victory
over
Syria
on
Friday
.

Takuya
Takagi
headed
the
winner
in
the
88th
minute
of
the
group
C
game
after
goalkeeper
Salem
Bitar
spoiled
a
mistake-free
display
by
allowing
the
ball
to
slip
under
his
body
.

It
was
the
second
Syrian
defensive
blunder
in
four
minutes
.

Defender
Hassan
Abbas
rose
to
intercept
a
long
ball
into
the
area
in
the
84th
minute
but
only
managed
to
divert
it
into
the
top
corner
of
Bitar
's
goal
.

Syria
had
taken
the
lead
from
their
first
serious
attack
in
the
seventh
minute
.

Nader
Jokhadar
headed
a
cross
from
the
right
by
Ammar
Awad
into
the
top
right
corner
of
Kenichi
Shimokawa
's
goal
.

Japan
then
laid
siege
to
the
Syrian
penalty
area
and
had
a
goal
disallowed
for
offside
in
the
16th
minute
.

A
minute
later
,
Bitar
produced
a
good
double
save
,
first
from
Kazuyoshi
Miura
's
header
and
then
blocked
a
Takagi
follow-up
shot
.

Bitar
saved
well
again
from
Miura
in
the
37th
minute
,
parrying
away
his
header
from
a
corner
.

Japan
started
the
second
half
brightly
but
Bitar
denied
them
an
equaliser
when
he
dived
to
his
right
to
save
Naoki
Soma
's
low
drive
in
the
53rd
minute
.

BLINKER
BAN

LONDON

Dutch

Blinker
had
his
indefinite
suspension
lifted
by
FIFA
on
Friday
and
was
set
to
make
his
Sheffield
Wednesday
comeback
against
Liverpool
on
Saturday
.

Blinker
missed
his
club
's

a
worldwide
ban
on
him
for
appearing
to
sign
contracts
for
both
Wednesday
and
Udinese
while
he
was
playing
for
Feyenoord
.

FIFA
's
players
'
status
committee

meeting
in
Barcelona
,
decided
that
although
the
Udinese
document
was
basically
valid
,
it
could
not
be
legally
protected
.

The
committee
said
the
Italian
club
had
violated
regulations
by
failing
to
inform
Feyenoord
,
with
whom
the
player
was
under
contract
.

Blinker
was
fined
75,000
Swiss
francs
(
$
57,600
)
for
failing
to
inform
the
Engllsh
club
of
his

LITTLE
TO
MISS
CAMPESE
FAREWELL
.

Robert
Kitson

LONDON
1996-12-06

Centre
Jason
Little
will
miss
Australia
's
end-of-tour
fixture
against
the
Barbarians
at
Twickenham
on
Saturday
.

Little
has
opted
not
to
risk
aggravating
the
knee
injury
which
ruled
him
out
of
a
large
chunk
of
the
tour
and
is
replaced
by
fellow
Queenslander
Daniel
Herbert
.

Owen
Finegan
has
recovered
from
the
knocks
he
took
in
last
weekend
's
test
against
Wales
and
retains
his
place
in
the
back-row
ahead
of
Daniel
Manu
.

The
Wallabies
have
their
sights
set
on
a
13th
successive
victory
to
end
their
European
tour
with
a
100
percent
record
but
also
want
to
turn
on
the
style
and
provide
David
Campese
with
a
fitting
send-off
in
his
final
match
in
Australian
colours
.

The
Wallabies
currently
have
no
plans
to
make
any
special
presentation
to
the
34-year-old
winger
but
a
full
house
of
75,000
spectators
will
still
gather
in
the
hope
of
witnessing
one
last
moment
of
magic
.

Campese
will
be
up
against
a
familiar
foe
in
the
shape
of
Barbarians
captain
Rob
Andrew
,
the
man
who
kicked
Australia
to
defeat
with
a
last-ditch
drop-goal
in
the
World
Cup
quarter-final
in
Cape
Town
.

"
Campo
has
a
massive
following
in
this
country
and
has
had
the
public
with
him
ever
since
he
first
played
here
in
1984
,
"
said
Andrew
,
also
likely
to
be
making
his
final
Twickenham
appearance
.

On
tour
,
Australia
have
won
all
four
tests
against
Italy
,
Scotland
,
Ireland
and
Wales
,
and
scored
414
points
at
an
average
of
almost
35
points
a
game
.

League
duties
restricted
the
Barbarians
'
selectorial
options
but
they
still
boast
13
internationals
including
England
full-back
Tim
Stimpson
and
recalled
wing
Tony
Underwood

plus

UNCAPPED
PLAYERS

TO

MACEDONIA
.

BUCHAREST
1996-12-06

LARA
ENDURES
ANOTHER
MISERABLE
DAY
.

Robert
Galvin

MELBOURNE
1996-12-06

Australia
gave
Brian
Lara
another
reason
to
be
miserable
when
they
beat
West
Indies
by
five
wickets
in
the
opening
World
Series
limited
overs
match
on
Friday
.

Lara
,
disciplined
for
misconduct
on
Wednesday
,
was
dismissed
for
five
to
extend
a
disappointing
run
of
form
on
tour
.

Australia
,
who
hold
a
2-0
lead
in
the
five-match
test
series
,
overhauled
West
Indies
'
total
of
172
all
out
with
eight
balls
to
spare
to
end
a
run
of
six
successive
one-day
defeats
.

All-rounder
Greg
Blewett
steered
his
side
to
a
comfortable
victory
with
an
unbeaten
57
in
90
balls
to
the
delight
of
the
42,442
crowd
.

Man-of-the
match
Blewett
came
to
the
wicket
with
the
total
on
70
for
two
and
hit
three
fours
during
an
untroubled
innings
lasting
129
minutes
.

His
crucial
fifth-wicket
partnership
with
fellow
all-rounder
Stuart
Law
,
who
scored
21
,
added
71
off
85
balls
.

Lara
looked
out
of
touch
during
his
brief
stay
at
the
crease
before
chipping
a
simple
catch
to
Shane
Warne
at
mid-wicket
.

West
Indies
tour
manager
Clive
Lloyd
has
apologised
for
Lara
's
behaviour
on
Tuesday
.

He
(
Lara
)
had
told
Australia
coach
Geoff
Marsh
that
wicketkeeper
Ian
Healy
was
unwelcome
in
the
visitors
'
dressing
room
.

The
Melbourne
crowd
were
clearly
angered
by
the
incident
,
loudly
jeering
the
West
Indies
vice-captain
as
he
walked
to
the
middle
.

It
was
left
to
fellow
left-hander
Shivnarine
Chanderpaul
to
hold
the
innings
together
with
a
gritty
54
despite
the
handicap
of
an
injured
groin
.

Chanderpaul
was
forced
to
rely
on
a
runner
for
most
of
his
innings
after
hurting
himself
as
he
scurried
back
to
his
crease
to
avoid
being
run
out
.

Pakistan
,
who
arrive
in
Australia
later
this
month
,
are
the
other
team
competing
in
the
World
Series
tournament
.
