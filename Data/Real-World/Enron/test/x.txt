At
this
time
,
the
OWA

Update
on
ConfirmLogic
I
wanted
to
give
you
a
quick
update
on
ConfirmLogic..
.

.

Testing
was
done
last
week
on
the
ConfirmLogic
module
.

On
Thursday
,
we
discussed
with
Kathryn
Cordes
and
the
ConfirmLogic
IT
team
the
items
that
we
had
found
that
were
"
show
stoppers
"
as
far
as
releasing
the
product
for
Beta
Testing
.

Some
of
the
major
Items
found
were
the
inability
to
properly
handle
Basis
Swaps
for
Gas
and
inability
to
display
meaningful
Index
References
for
Power
(
they
were
pulling
in
a
code
rather
than
a
description
of
the
Index
)
.

The
team
worked
on
the
"
fixes
"
and
migrated
the
code
last
night
.

Today
during
testing
,
they
found
that
the
new
code
had
actually
caused
problems
with
the
fixed
price
and
volume
information
,
which
was
working
previously
.

I
talked
to
Kathryn
and
she
said
that
the
were
rebuilding
the
code
.

She
said
that
someone
had
tested
the
fix
last
night
and
everything
worked
fine
.

We
plan
more
testing
in
the
morning
.

They
are
doing
a
high-level
demo
this
Thursday
for
Beta
Customers
just
to
introduce
the
module
.

They
were
planning
on
having
more
extensive
Beta
demos
for
each
client
starting
next
week
but
realize
that
those
may
have
to
postponed
further
.

We
have
told
them
that
we
would
not
sign
off
for
Beta
testing
until
we
were
comfortable
that
the
items
that
we
identified
were
working
.

We
need
consistent
,
stable
days
of
testing
before
I
will
feel
comfortable
.

Overall
,
we
like
the
"
new
"
streamlined
version
of
the
screens
and
feel
that
it
will
be
a
good
product
if
they
can
work
out
the
data
display
issues
.

Call
with
any
questions
.

Hi
All
,
As
of
today
,
MetaStock
has
several
new
functions
.

The
most
important
new
feature
is
the
ability
to
display
forward
HEAT
RATE
charts
.

Also
,
notice
that
the
interface
looks
different
--
this
reflects
and
accommodates
the
new
features
.

The
help
files
(
on
the
left
of
the
applet
)
fully
describe
and
explain
all
the
changes
and
additions
to
the
program
.

If
you
have
any
questions
regarding
this
new
version
of
MetaStock
,
please
contact
Anna
Santucci
(
x
.

34225
)
for
user
questions
or
Mark
Symms
(
x
.

33105
)
for
technical
questions
.

And
,
of
course
,
you
can
ask
these
questions
once
you
log
into
the
MegaWatt
Station
(
the
virtual
one
)
.

Good
Morning
,
I
spoke
with
Ilkka
yesterday
(
prior
to
Robert
Quick
prohibiting
to
speak
to
him
.

)
He
asked
me
to
deliver
to
John
Nowlan
the
following
message:
Regarding
the
Vneshtoprom
case
,
if
he
is
let
to
,
he
is
willing
to
come
to
work
solely
to
try
to
sort
out
Vneshtoprom
's
debt
to
Enron
.

He
thinks
that
in
a
month
he
has
either
been
able
to
get
Vneshtoprom
pay
back
the
prepayment
money
or
at
least
gotten
an
original
signed
statement
from
them
that
how
big
the
debt
is
and
a
schedule
to
return
the
money
.

After
the
job
is
done
he
would
then
leave
the
company
with
whatever
terms
and
conditions
you
guys
would
then
sort
out
between
yourselves
.

If
he
is
let
to
try
to
sort
out
the
Vneshtopron
debt
,
he
wants
to
do
it
without
Kevin
Beasley
's
or
Goran
Novokovic
's
help
.

The
feeling
I
got
was
that
he
is
ready
to
negotiate
this
thing
as
quckly
as
possible
to
an
end
.

I
hope
I
have
been
able
to
summarize
his
thoughts
in
that
way
that
you
would
at
least
have
a
conversation
with
him
.

I
think
his
orders
are
at
the
moment
to
sit
home
and
wait
for
Kevin
's
call
.

The
way
I
personally
see
the
Vneshtoprom
case
is
that
without
Ilkka
's
help
there
is
nobody
who
can
do
anything
to
help
Enron
get
any
money
back
.

Whatever
happened
last
friday
in
Moscow
,
whatever
accusations
where
made
by
Vneshtoprom
,
I
personally
feel
that
the
only
reason
for
all
that
was
to
get
Ilkka
out
of
the
picture
.

Hi
Larry
,
Since
it
's
been
a
month
since
we
emailed
you
our
list
of
recommendations
,
we
wanted
to
check
back
with
you
and
see
if
there
is
anything
we
can
do
to
help
you
with
your
diamond
buying
decision
?

Our
goal
is
to
help
you
make
an
informed
decision
that
you
will
be
happy
with
for
years
to
come
.

Remember
,
since
we
don't
own
these
stones
,
we
are
your
personal
diamonds
consultants
who
will
work
to
find
the
very
best
diamond
for
you
at
a
great
price
.

If
you
have
any
questions
about
diamonds
or
the
diamond
buying
process
please
give
Anne
or
me
a
call
at
the
toll
free
number
below
or
email
us
.

We
take
calls
until
about
9:00
p.m.
EST
since
we
are
dealing
with
customers
and
suppliers
on
the
West
Coast
.

We
find
that
serious
diamond
buyers
always
want
to
call
and
visit
with
us
so
that
we
can
better
understand
your
needs
and
answer
any
of
your
questions
.

Email
works
great
for
shopping
,
but
the
telephone
is
the
better
way
to
conduct
business
for
such
an
important
purchase
.

Looking
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
!

P.S
.

If
you
have
already
purchased
,
please
let
us
know
in
a
reply
to
this
message
so
we
will
know
not
to
send
any
more
follow
up
messages
.

Mark
,
The
pay
equity
issue
sounds
like
the
reviews
we
do
every
year
to
ensure
that
people
are
being
paid
equitably
.

Given
that
the
company
has
until
November
of
next
year
to
get
in
compliance
and
to
report
out
on
the
compliance
issue
,
it
should
be
no
big
deal
--
unless
there
currently
are
pay
inequities
.

A
list
of
persons
in
each
job
,
with
salary
and
gender
,
could
allow
us
to
determine
whether
an
issue
even
exists
.

Based
upon
your
memo
and
our
due
diligence
effort
to
date
,
is
there
any
indication
of
(
a
)
any
steps
Daishowa
has
taken
to
put
the
committee
required
under
the
Pay
Equity
Act
or
(
b
)
any
increase
in
compensation
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
Pay
Equity
Act
and
therefore
enable
Daishowa
to
dispense
with
the
need
for
a
committee
?

Is
there
any
way
to
currently
assess
what
potential
liabilities
could
be
or
to
view
any
industry
data
on
this
issue
that
may
indicate
how
extensive
liability
could
be
?
?
?

The
main
concern
is
that
we
are
negotiating
with
Daishowa
to
be
in
a
position
to
undertake
,
as
of
closing
,
all
responsibilities
associated
with
all
matters
disclosed
,
unless
there
is
a
legal
noncompliance
issue
(
e.g.
,
failure
to
maintain
proper
permits
)
.

Since
the
requirements
of
the
Pay
Equity
Act
have
not
been
identified
to
management
as
a
concern
,
I
need
to
ensure
that
this
is
a
real
issue
(
mostly
from
a
$
's
exposure
standpoint
)
vs.
something
so
remote
that
it
should
not
even
be
discussed
.

Please
let
me
know
your
thoughts
.

Thanks

Note:
With
Dynegy
as
anchor
,
NGPL
is
planning
on
building
a
lateral
into
St.
Louis
for
the
first
time
.

MRT
(
a
Reliant
pipeline
)
has
been
the
only
pipeline
into
this
market
.

NGPL
Plans
Lateral
to
Serve
Illinois
Power
in
St.
Louis
Natural
Gas
Pipeline
Company
of
America
(
NGPL
)
announced
plans
to
build
a
new
47-mile
,
24-inch
diameter
pipeline
lateral
into
St.
Louis
to
serve
Illinois
Power
's
gas
distribution
system
.

The
$35
million
project
,
which
is
anchored
by
a
contract
with
Illinois
Power
affiliate
Dynegy
Marketing
and
Trade
,
will
add
at
least
300,000
Dth/d
of
gas
transportation
capacity
to
the
St.
Louis
market
.

"
The
pipeline
project
and
related
agreements
ideally
demonstrate
our
ongoing
strategy
to
expand
our
natural
gas
pipeline
services
into
growing
markets
currently
not
connected
to
NGPL
and
to
increase
throughput
on
our
system
by
adding
electric
load
to
our
extensive
pipeline
network
,
"
said
Richard
D.
Kinder
,
CEO
of
Kinder
Morgan
Inc.
,
the
parent
company
of
NGPL
.

The
new
lateral
will
extend
from
Centralia
,
IL
,
to
a
point
on
Illinois
Power
's
gas
distribution
system
in
the
East
St.
Louis
market
.

The
project
is
scheduled
for
completion
in
June
of
2002
.

NGPL
and
Dynegy
entered
into
a
number
of
long-term
,
gas
transportation
and
storage
contracts
,
including
a
10-year
agreement
effective
June
1
,
2002
,
which
will
provide
Dynegy
with
90,000
Dth/d
of
gas
via
the
new
pipeline
.

In
addition
,
NGPL
and
Dynegy
entered
into
various
other
firm
transportation
agreements
totaling
another
98,000
Dth/d
of
gas
sourced
from
NGPL
's
Gulf
Coast
and
Amarillo
lines
beginning
as
early
as
Dec.
1
,
2000
.

The
NGPL
project
effectively
creates
a
new
supplier
for
a
geographical
area
that
until
now
has
been
served
by
just
one
natural
gas
transportation
company
[
Mississippi
River
Transmission
,
according
to
Larry
F.
Altenbaumer
,
president
of
Illinois
Power
.

"
This
new
connection
to
Illinois
Power
's
system
will
help
open
competitive
opportunities
to
natural
gas
customers
in
the
metro
east
area
of
St.
Louis
.

It
not
only
provides
for
a
new
delivery
point
to
service
customers
directly
,
but
also
to
fuel
electric
generation
in
the
area
.

"
The
10-year
agreement
to
provide
firm
transportation
service
to
Dynegy
provides
us
a
solid
anchor
customer
for
the
pipeline
project
,
"
said
Deb
Macdonald
,
president
of
NGPL
.

NGPL
intends
to
solicit
expressions
of
interest
from
other
shippers
in
December
and
January
.

The
results
of
the
open
season
will
determine
the
final
scope
of
the
project
.

"
With
Dynegy
as
our
anchor
customer
,
we
will
build
the
new
lateral
into
the
St.
Louis
market
regardless
of
whether
we
receive
other
expressions
of
interest
,
"
said
Macdonald
.

"
We
anticipate
a
strong
response
,
however
,
given
the
size
of
the
market
and
the
potential
for
additional
gas-fired
power
generation
.

"

shippers

RECENT
EVENTS:
--
AB
8x
(
Migden
)
,
which
would
give
the
EOB
additional
and
undefined
powers
related
to
the
coordination
of
operation
and
maintenance
schedules
,
passed
the
Assembly
ECA
committee
14
to
0
.

This
measure
came
from
the
Governor=01=
,
s
office
in
response
to
one
of
his
Executive
Orders
.

IEP
,
along
with
several
IEP
members
,
opposed
the
bill
in
committee
,
but
noted
commitments
to
workin=
g
with
the
author
on
language
.

IEP
counsel
drafted
comments
which
are
attached
.

PLEASE
PROVIDE
COMMENT
BY
NOON
ON
MONDAY
so
that
these
changes
may
be
considered
by
the
author
before
the
next
committee
hearing
.

The
measure
will
go
to
the
Assembly
Appropriations
Committee
next
.

--
AB
60x
(
Hertzberg
)
,
which
would
have
required
,
as
a
condition
of
permitting
a
powerplant
,
developers
to
offer
to
sell
the
power
to
Californi=
a
entities
,
was
pulled
from
the
Assembly
ECA
Committee
hearing
at
the
last
minute
.

IEP
is
working
with
the
Chair
of
the
committee
and
the
Speaker=01
,
=
s
office
on
appropriate
language
that
would
preferably
not
be
tied
to
the
siting
process
but
provide
the
needed
political
cover
on
this
new
,
growing
=01&
California
First=018
concept
.

Any
suggestions
on
how
to
deal
with
the
=01&
California
First=018
issue
is
welcomed
.

--
IEP
,
along
with
the
other
QF
stakeholders
,
had
an
opportunity
to
brief
the
Senate
Energy
Committee
staff
on
SB
47x
(
Battin
)
.

The
measure
will
be
heard
in
the
committee
on
Tuesday
next
week
.

--
The
Senate
Environmental
Quality
committee
met
this
week
to
hear
SB
28x
(
Sher
/
Battin
)
which
makes
various
changes
to
the
siting
process
including
many
IEP-sponsored
proposals
.

So
far
this
is
the
most
comprehensive
and
positive
siting
bill
introduced
,
with
the
greatest
chance
of
moving
forward=
.

The
bill
passed
out
of
the
committee
on
a
7
to
0
vote
even
though
most
of
the
environmental
community
testified
in
opposition
.

Chris
Ellison
and
I
are
continuing
to
work
with
the
authors=01
,
staff
to
develop
additional
language
which
should
be
available
before
the
measure
is
heard
in
the
Senat=e
Energy
Committee
on
Tuesday
.

--
AB
45x
(
Kelley
)
also
passed
7
to
0
out
of
the
Assembly
Revenue
and
Taxation
Committee
this
week
.

AB
45x
would
extend
the
manufacturers
investment
credit
(
MIC
)
to
include
the
generation
of
electricity
through
th=
e
use
of
solar
,
wind
,
geothermal
,
solid-fuel
biomass
,
waste
tire
,
municipal
solid
waste
,
digester
gas
,
or
hydropower
with
a
generating
capacity
of
30
megawatts
or
less
.

The
bill
does
not
include
a
generator
who
produces
electricity
for
sale
to
a
utility
pursuant
to
a
contract
originally
entered
into
before
January
1
,
2001
.

The
committee
staff
estimates
revenue
losses
in
the
range
of
$5
to
$10
million
annually
beginning
in
2001-02
.

Sponsored
by
CalEnergy
,
AB
45x
will
heard
in
the
Assembly
Appropriations
Committee
next
.

--
AB
36x
(
Wright
)
,
which
would
apply
specified
repower
projects
to
the
6-month
expedited
siting
process
established
in
AB
970
(
2000
)
,
passed
out
o=
f
the
Assembly
Energy
Costs
and
Availability
Committee
17
to
0
.

IEP
testifie=
d
in
support
of
the
bill
,
noting
we
were
still
working
with
the
author
on
language
.

IEP
continues
to
believe
that
with
the
current
language
,
few
,
if
any
,
projects
would
qualify
and
is
working
with
staff
on
fixing
that
.

Recent
conversations
,
however
,
with
one
of
Asm
.

Wright
=01
,
s
staff
indicates
Wrights
would
be
willing
to
drop
the
bill
if
the
language
IEP
wants
is
already
in
another
measure
(
SB
28x
)
.

Wright
would
then
carry
some
other
siting
language
IEP
supports
and
not
in
any
other
vehicle
.

I
will
be
follow-up
on
this
next
week
and
welcome
any
suggestions
.

ACR
4x
(
Cohn
)
,
which
urges
the
CEC
to
move
swiftly
to
license
the
Metcal=f
Energy
Center
and
to
permit
its
construction.
,
passed
off
the
Assembly
floo=
r
71
to
0
.

The
measure
,
which
has
5
primary
authors
and
42
co-authors
,
is
headed
to
the
Senate
a
policy
committee
hearing
.

--
A
hearing
in
the
Assembly
Natural
Resources
Committee
for
AB
34x
(
La
Suer
)
,
which
would
make
various
changes
to
the
siting
process
,
including
some
IEP-sponsored
proposals
,
was
put
off
again
.

The
author
will
be
accepting
amendments
that
will
make
it
a
study
bill
in
the
special
session
.

The
author
will
try
to
move
the
larger
measure
in
its
original
form
during
the
regular
session
.

--
The
Senate
Energy
Committee
held
an
informational
hearing
on
Energy
Market
Reform
this
week
.

Stakeholders
,
especially
the
generators
,
were
grilled
on
current
market
problems
and
solutions
.

Senator
Bowen
,
Chair
of
the
committee
,
was
clearly
unhappy
with
generator=01
,
s
comments
.

It
is
unclear
,
however
,
how
forthcoming
her
staff
was
regarding
what
participants
should
have
been
prepare
for
in
terms
of
the
of
the
line
of
questioning
tha=
t
came
primarily
from
Senators
Bowen
and
Dunn
.

Bowen
suggested
she
was
going
to
hold
another
hearing
on
the
issue
on
a
date
to
be
determined
later
.

--
Attached
is
the
most
recent
legislative
tracking
report
of
all
the
special
session
bills
introduced
to
date
.

I
have
separated
out
the
regular
session
list
of
bills
since
the
list
was
getting
out
of
control
.

I
will
send
that
list
under
separate
cover
as
I=01
,
m
still
plowing
through
the
ove=
r
1,300
bills
that
were
introduced
last
Friday
.

Please
let
me
know
if
you
need
copies
of
any
of
these
bills

and
provided
this
beautiful
garden
and
all
of
these
wonderful
animals
and
that
hilarious
comedic
snake
,
but
I
'm
just
not
happy
.

"
"
Why
is
that
,
Eve
?

"
came
the
reply
from
above
.

"
Lord
,
I
am
lonely
,
and
I
'm
sick
to
death
of
apples
.

"
"
Well
Eve
,
in
that
case
,
I
have
a
solution
.

I
shall
create
a
man
for
you
.

"
"
What
's
a
man
,
Lord
?

"
"
This
man
will
be
a
flawed
creature
,
with
many
bad
traits
.

He'll
lie
,
cheat
and
be
vainglorious
;
all
in
all
,
he'll
give
you
a
hard
time
.

But...he'll
be
bigger
,
faster
,
and
will
like
to
hunt
and
kill
things
.

He
will
look
silly
when
he
's
aroused
,
but
since
you
've
been
complaining
,
I'll
create
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
will
satisfy
your
physical
needs
.

He
will
be
witless
and
will
revel
in
childish
things
like
fighting
and
kicking
a
ball
about
.

He
won't
be
too
smart
,
so
he'll
also
need
your
advice
to
think
properly
.

"
"
Sounds
great
.

"
says
Eve
,
with
an
ironically
raised
eyebrow
.

"
What
's
the
catch
,
Lord
?

"
"
Well...
you
can
have
him
on
one
condition
.

"
"
What
's
that
,
Lord
?

"
"
As
I
said
,
he'll
be
proud
,
arrogant
,
and
self-admiring.
.

.

So
you'll
have
to
let
him
believe
that
I
made
him
first
.

Just
remember
,
it
's
our
little
secret.
.

.

Y'know....Woman
to
woman.
.

Gathering
System
?
?

TotalFinaElf
plans
to
construct
a
natural
gas
gathering
project
with
its
north
American
partners
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
enabling
the
development
of
three
deep
offshore
natural
gas
fields
.

The
project
consisted
of
a
56-mile
pipeline
with
a
transmission
capacity
of
500
MMcf
per
day
and
a
processing
platform
,
owned
and
operated
by
Williams.
?

Construction
of
the
Canyon
Express
pipeline
,
in
the
Mississippi
Canyon
area
about
120
miles
southeast
of
New
Orleans
,
will
begin
next
year
.

The
gathering
system
will
begin
operating

,
at
the
same
time
as
the
three
natural
gas
fields
,
Aconcagua
,
King
's
Peak
and
Camden
Hills
.

Canyon
Express
was
a
major
technological
breakthrough
for
TotalFinaElf
,
making
it
possible
to
undertake
oil
and
natural
gas
operations
at
previously
untapped
depths
of
over
6,000
feet
.

The
gas
gathering
system
will
be
operated
by
Elf
Exploration
and
belong
to
the
companies
who
owned
the
Aconcagua
,
King
's
Peak
and
Camden
Hills
fields
.

Aconcagua
is
operated
by
Elf
Exploration
which
has
a
50%
stake
in
the
field
.

Enron
affiliate
,
Mariner
Energy
,
and
Pioneer
Natural
Resources
each
own
25%
.

King
's
Peak
is
wholly-owned
and
operated
by
BP
Amoco
.

Camden
Hills
is
operated
by
Marathon
,
with
a
50%
stake
.

Total
Exploration
Production
USA
owns
16.67%
and
Pioneer
owns
33.3%
.

Aconcagua
will
own
45%
;
King
's
Peak
,
35%
;
and
Camden
Hills
20%
of
the
Canyon
Express
pipeline

.

The
highway
route
is
being
promoted
by
Foothills
Pipe
Lines
while
Arctic
Resources
is
promoting
the
Beaufort
Sea
route
.

The
North
Slope
has
natural
gas
reserves
of
over
35
Tcf
,
and
many
believe
the
potential
reserves
could
exceed
100
Tcf
.

Currently
,
oil
producers
produce
about
8
MMcf
per
day
of
natural
gas
and
re-inject
almost
all
of
it
into
oil
reservoirs
to
build
up
pressure
there
and
enhance
future
recovery
